You are free to use my system and scripts. This project is mainly for people to check out my coding style and experience

I recently created a simple pirate themed game using Unity and C#. I followed my own unique coding style while sticking to best practices. This project gave me the chance to explore some fun mechanics and systems that can easily grow into a full game.

The game is a top down naval adventure where you control a pirate ship. When you move, your anchor is clearly seen rising, giving players useful feedback. The main mission for now is to destroy all enemy ships. But there is more to it. I added an Eagle Eye vision system that lets players scout enemy ships, find out details about their captains, and see how much rum and wood they are carrying. These resources can be used to repair your ship or use the rum to deal more damage to enemy ships.

The enemy ships are not just floating targets. They are smart enough to avoid each other, move around the map, and shoot at you. I also used object pooling to manage performance and reuse objects instead of creating and destroying them all the time.

This pirate game is just the beginning. It has a lot of room to grow with more levels, ship upgrades, smarter enemies, and a full story. I am excited to keep working on it and see how far I can take it.
